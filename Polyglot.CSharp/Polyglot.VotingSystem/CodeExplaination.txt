Explanation of the Code:
Candidates and Votes:

We create a list candidates that holds the names of the candidates (e.g., Alice, Bob, Charlie).
We use an integer array votes to store the number of votes for each candidate. The index in votes corresponds to the index in the candidates list.
Voting Process:

The program enters a loop where it displays the candidates and asks the user to vote by entering the number corresponding to a candidate.
The user’s input is validated to ensure they enter a valid number (1, 2, or 3), and then the program increments the vote count for the selected candidate.
Loop Control:

After each vote, the user is asked if they want to continue voting. If they enter n, the loop ends, and the voting process stops.
Vote Count Display:

Once voting ends, the program prints the number of votes each candidate received.
Winner or Tie:

The program checks which candidate received the highest number of votes. If there is a tie, it informs the user; otherwise, it announces the winner.
How to Run It:
Open Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
Create a new Console Application project.
Replace the Program.cs content with the code above.
Run the application and follow the prompts.
Features You Could Add:
Input Validation: Handle edge cases like empty or non-numeric input more robustly.
Multiple Voters: Track individual voters by adding voter IDs or names.
Vote Limit: Set a limit for the number of votes a user can cast.
Persistent Data: Use file storage to save results for future reference.
This project is great for practicing loops, arrays or lists, conditionals, and user input handling in C#.
