Explanation of the Code:
Choices Array: An array (choices[]) holds the possible moves: "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors".
Random Class: We use Random to generate a random choice for the computer.
Game Loop: The game runs in a loop until the user decides to quit by entering n.
User Input Validation: We ensure the user enters valid input, and if not, the loop continues.
Game Logic:
The computer's choice and the user's choice are compared using simple if conditions to determine who wins.
The player wins if they follow the winning rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
Otherwise, the computer wins.
Play Again: After each round, the program asks if the user wants to play again, and the loop continues until they answer "n".
How to Run It:
Open Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
Create a new Console Application project.
Replace the Program.cs content with the code above.
Run the application.
This is a basic but fun way to demonstrate the use of conditionals, loops, random number generation, and user interaction in C#.
